# UDACITY Data Analysis Nanodegree Project: 02: Data Wrangling and Reporting using Python
This project's goal is to wrangle WeRateDogs' Twitter data and produce reliable analyses and visuals. Although it only provides very minimal tweet data, the Twitter archive for more than 5000 of their tweets is great.

The twitter archive master.csv file was produced by cleaning and concatenating the three datasets of the Twitter WeRateDogs data. 
# Questions
A few conclusions drawn from the dataset are as follows: 
- Do dog tweets with high rating numerators have a higher level of confidence?
- Which Twitter handle was the most used in 2015?
- How much has test level performance improved between 2015 and 2017?
